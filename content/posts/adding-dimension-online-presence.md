(These are a few posts from my tumblr about the timeline project – moving them over here so they’re all in the same place. Some of these are WIP that never P’ed. NOTE: this was written before FB Timeline so in that context it makes more sense…)

I love facebook(insert twitter/linkedin etc). I use it daily as a tool to keep connected to the people in my life. I use it to keep up with my siblings as well as more distant relatives; I keep tabs on coworkers past and present; I stay connected to people I’ve met from around the world by viewing their profiles on this social-media platform. Likewise, when I want to share what’s happening in my life I update my profile as an attempt to communicate and keep in touch with these people.

One drawback to the current state of one’s online presence is the lack of dimensionality; my current facebook profile tells you a bit about what i’m doing currently, the concert i’m attending this weekend, etc but doesn’t go much beyond that.

A profile consists of:

current photo
current age
current town
current job/school
current/recent checkins
etc but it’s really just a sliver of a representation of a person’s life.

The missing element from the online profile is time.
If you want to add dimension or depth to the profile you need to add TIME.

There are some attempts at adding time to the profile, such as:

photos grouped by event,
basic job history
limited school history
hometown
date of birth
add-ons, such as the ‘where i’ve been’ map
but not a ton beyond that.
