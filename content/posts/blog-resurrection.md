I rage-quit my blog a few years ago. 

Ive since written some articles on Medium and elsewhere, but I felt like I needed a better place to put my thoughts.

<br>

### Content

I pulled what I could from archive.org; the old posts are there just for me and most of the content is pretty dated, but wanted to at least use what existed out in the ether as a starting point.

<br>

### Technologies

I've built this with Nuxt using Vue, which exports flat files that can be hosted and run all on the client-side.

I'm writing everything in markdown for simplicity.

I'm hosting the site on an S3 bucket on AWS.

I'll work on the CSS as time permits.
