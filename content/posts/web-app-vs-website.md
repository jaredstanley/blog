I want to explain what I think ‘web app’, a term I keep hearing, means:

<br>


Different from a native app downloaded from a curated ‘app store’, this term is used to describe an application that is accessed via the browser on your phone or desktop.

<br>

So what’s the difference between a web app and a website?
THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE. THEY CAN BE USED INTERCHANGEABLY. There’s no real difference.

[People](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1959910/web-site-vs-web-application) often [try](http://theappslab.com/2010/11/12/website-vs-web-app/) to differentiate the two, even developers, but unfortunately the definitions just don’t work.

<br>

The best one that could maybe work is this:

<br>

**Websites:** Websites are sites that are primarily informational. So [whitehouse.gov](http://whitehouse.gov/) and [sizzler.com](http://sizzler.com) would be classified as a website because you go there to get information.

**Web applications:** These allow the user to perform actions, more like a tool. So [hotmail.com](hotmail.com) is a tool, you go to send/receive email. it’s an app. So is [amazon.com](amazon.com), where you go to buy things. If it’s a tool in some way then it’s classified as an app.

<br>

There are many problems with this differentiation: What if sizzler.com adds a tool and allows you to perform actions? Say a funny-video contest or they allow you to order online?
What if whitehouse.gov allows you to register to vote?
Seems like hotmail allows you to access information without sending/receiving mail when you go to look up old contacts or addresses.
Is amazon an app when you buy something but a site if you’re only looking up product dimensions?

<br>

This is the best classification I could find and as you can see it doesn’t hold up.

<br>

Other groupings exist(like the usage of server-side languages vs static files), but there are huge holes to be shot through any of these as well.

<br>

The term is very useful in meetings to sound fancy but ultimately:

<br>

WEB APP == WEBSITE. *(fixed hyperbolic example, would not actually run.)

<br>

(NOTE: The terms website / web app are not terms exclusive to mobile; these terms similarly describe desktop websites / web apps.)

<br>

***UPDATE:**
Every developer who I’ve shown this to so far feels strongly that while it’s an extremely gray area there is indeed a difference between an app and a site. Maybe we are looking at it the wrong way; rather than grouping them, we should be placing them on a scale, from site to app, defining them based on their complexity. At some point as a website becomes more complex it becomes an app. Viewed this way, there’s no such thing as a simple web app(it’s just a website with basic functionality) and no such thing as a complex website(it’s a web application with complex functionality).

<br>

This is my larger point: if devs are arguing nuance, why are marketers attempting to distinguish between the two?

<br>

One can argue that this is just semantics, but it seems as though (non-technical)marketers’ attempts to define the technologies have overtaken the actual technology. This leads to mixed expectations in terms of budget, timing, and effectiveness. If we could simplify/clarify buzz words and focus on using technology to solve a problem, we will be able to communicate to our clients and (non-technical)team members much more effectively.
