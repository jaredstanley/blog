(These are a few posts from my tumblr about the timeline project – moving them over here so they’re all in the same place. Some of these are WIP that never P’ed)

Privacy examples:

Bronk targeted his victims by searching Facebook for women who posted both their e-mail addresses and also personal information such as their favorite foods, their father’s middle names, their high-school mascots and their favorite colors.
Such details are routinely used in “identity challenges” when changes are made to online personal accounts..

so this kid:

searched on facebook for accounts with publicly facing email accounts
if the emails were from hotmail for example, he would go to hotmail and say ‘i forgot the pw of this account’
then he would get a security question. he would search on the facebook profile for the answer.
once in, he would change the pw and own the account.
he would then go to the ‘sent mail’ folders, find naked pics and proceed to email them to everyone on the contact list.
the kid then got all perverty but this first part is pretty funny.

Popcap games are great; they compare your scores against all of your facebook friends – i play a game, get a score, and then see where it compares among my friends who also have played the game.
An unintended piece of data: it also tallys how often you play; rather, it gives you an award depending on your score…all but the lowest scores earn you a medal so you essentially get one each time you play.

You can get an idea about which friends might have addictive personalities or just too much free time by monitoring their playing habits.

The concern w/ online privacy is valid; ppls gettin’ their cc numbers stolen all over the place.

Big data conferences have historically been 100% for B2B clients, but in the last couple years there have been B2C product offerings. People are increasingly wary of what they’re sharing online, and for good reason.

We need to understand that privacy is possible without necessarily being private. We can live our lives digitally, with privacy, while being more socially transparent. Being private keeps us from being able to share who we really are.

As our online presence grows and further mirrors our IRL lives, privacy will be exponentially imperative; being private is merely a personality trait.
